# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

However, many of today's most valuable companies have realized that analyzing and improving individual workers - a practice known as "employee performance improvement" - is not enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern business is increasingly team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that "time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has increased by 50 percent or more" over the past two decades and that in many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee's day in communicating with colleagues.

Any group can become a team. Sakaguchi's experiments underscore a key lesson from Google's research in teamwork: By adopting a data-driven approach in Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle encouraged emotional conversations and debates about standards among people who might be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. “Google people love data,” Sakaguchi told me. But it's not just Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that eschews emotional conversations. Most workplaces do this. “By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it’s easier to talk about,” Sakaguchi told me. "It's easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number."

# How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the first web servers, which sent documents across the Internet and then did a lot of research to explain why the web worked the way it does. Its name is written in the specification for the protocol used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

We've been doing this for a long time but none of the technologies we use today work well when you need to be able to talk to all devices in the entire world.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP: is a protocol created by Fielding and his friends - and it's all about applying verbs to nouns. For example, when you go to a webpage, the browser does an HTTP entry at the URL you typed and returns to the webpage.

4. What does a GET do?

GET is used to request data from a specific resource and is one of the most common HTTP methods.

5. What does a POST do?

POST is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.

6. What does PUT do?

The PUT method is used to update the resources available on the server. It usually replaces whatever is in the target URL with something else. You can use it to create a new resource or overwrite an existing resource. PUT requires that the attached entity be stored under the required required URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

7. What does PATCH do?

A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, repair, or improve it. This includes fixing vulnerabilities and other bugs, and these patches are usually called bug fixes or bug fixes.
